# 1. Introduction
## 1.1. What is Big Data ?
- The definition of big data is data that contains greater variety, arriving in increasing volumes and with more velocity. This is also known as the three Vs.
## 1.2. The history of big data
- Around 2005, people began to realize just how much data users generated through Facebook, YouTube, and other online services. 
- `Apache Hadoop` (an open-source framework created specifically to store and analyze big data sets) was developed that same year
- The development of open-source frameworks, such as Hadoop (and more recently, `Apache Spark` in 2014) was essential for the growth of big data because they make big data easier to work with and cheaper to store.
- `Cloud computing` has expanded big data possibilities even further. The cloud offers truly elastic scalability, where developers can simply spin up ad hoc clusters to test a subset of data.
- [`Graph databases`](https://www.oracle.com/sg/big-data/what-is-graph-database/) are becoming increasingly important as well, with their ability to display massive amounts of data in a way that makes analytics fast and comprehensive.
