# 1. Introduction
## 1.1. What is Big Data ?
- The term “big data” refers to data that is so large, fast or complex that it’s difficult or impossible to process using traditional methods
- Big data is defined data that contains greater variety, arriving in increasing volumes and with more velocity. This is also known as the `three Vs`.
  - **Volume**: Organizations collect data from a variety of sources, including business transactions, smart (IoT) devices, industrial equipment, videos, social media and more. In the past, storing it would have been a problem – but cheaper storage on platforms like data lakes and Hadoop have eased the burden.
  - **Velocity**: With the growth in the Internet of Things, data streams in to businesses at an unprecedented speed and must be handled in a timely manner. RFID tags, sensors and smart meters are driving the need to deal with these torrents of data in near-real time.
  - **Variety**: Data comes in all types of formats – from structured, numeric data in traditional databases to unstructured text documents, emails, videos, audios, stock ticker data and financial transactions.
-  2 additional dimensions: `Value` (no use until that value is discovered) and `Veracity` (quality of data) 
## 1.2. The history of big data
- Around 2005, people began to realize just how much data users generated through Facebook, YouTube, and other online services. 
- `Apache Hadoop` (an open-source framework created specifically to store and analyze big data sets) was developed that same year
- The development of open-source frameworks, such as Hadoop (and more recently, `Apache Spark` in 2014) was essential for the growth of big data because they make big data easier to work with and cheaper to store.
- `Cloud computing` has expanded big data possibilities even further. The cloud offers truly elastic scalability, where developers can simply spin up ad hoc clusters to test a subset of data.
- [`Graph databases`](https://www.oracle.com/sg/big-data/what-is-graph-database/) are becoming increasingly important as well, with their ability to display massive amounts of data in a way that makes analytics fast and comprehensive.
